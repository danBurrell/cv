    <em><strong>Web Developer</strong>, Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Mathematician,
      Educator</em>
  </p>
  <a href="contactMe.html">Contact Me</a>
  <p>
    I am a <strong>Web Developer</strong> with a background in mathematics
    and education at secondary and tertiary levels. After a career spanning
    nearly 20 years working as a statistical consultant and statistics and
    mathematics educator, I decided to change direction and move into web
    development, software development, data science and cyber security.
    <strong>My primary focus is on web development at this point in my learning
      journey.</strong> I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I
    am also proficient in the R, Python3 and Julia languages in the context
    of data science, numerical computing and statistical modeling. My
    knowledge of the Python3 language extends beyond data science to the wider
    web and software development arenas, including back-end web development
    with Django. I also dabble in Haskell.
